## Notes
The application requires a sleek, academic, yet modern aesthetic.
We need to handle the `animationCode` securely using an iframe or sanitized HTML.
Authentication is handled via Replit Auth, so we rely on `useAuth`.
The lesson generation might take time, so robust loading states are essential.
